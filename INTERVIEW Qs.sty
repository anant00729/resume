INTERVIEW Qs 

What was one challenge you faced, and how did you overcame it. 

I was given the responsibility of lead a team of eight backend developers 
at Tata Digital. During that time, we were faced with approximately 40 bugs of varying 
severities that needed to be resolved within a one-month timeframe. 
To tackle this challenge, I adopted a straightforward approach.

To ensure effective progress, I used to plan and prepare before our daily stand-up meetings, 
outlining the tasks that each developer, including myself, needed to accomplish by 
the end of the day. Our daily target involved addressing around 5 to 6 bugs, encompassing 
two high-priority issues and several minor bugs. Additionally, we prioritized reviewing 
pull requests and  monitored the unit test cases we had implemented for our application.

By following a well-planned process and ensuring that everyone on the team was aware 
of the progress and any potential blockers, we successfully navigated the challenge. 
This approach allowed us to tackle a significant number of bugs and make steady progress 
towards resolving them within the given timeframe.

I was given the reposiblity to lead the team of 8 backend developers 
at tata digital. we had somewhere around 40 bugs with low to high servierity. Those bugs needs to be resolved withing one months time 
period. To overcome this, I kept things quite simple. I always prepared before the stand up meeting and plan what needs to be done by each 
developer including myself by the end of the day. So our taget for everyday used to be solving 5 to 6 bugs which includes 
2 high priority bugs and some minnor bugs. We also kept a check on reviewing PRs and montored the unit test cases that we wrote for our application. I think following a planned process and keeping everone aware of the progress and the blockers helped me to overcome the challenge.  

Why did you apply for Bell? 

Working at Bell would provide me with a strong foundation and contribute to my 
growth as a software developer. The company offers numerous opportunities and 
programs that can enhance my skills. I am flexible and open to working as a software 
developer, whether it's in the capacity of a full stack developer or a data engineer. 
Bell's commitment to maintaining a diverse environment is advantageous as it promotes 
collaboration and learning among peers, allowing me to share knowledge and acquire 
new insights from others.

Why Bell and which of Bell’s programs are you most interested in. 

Having recently completed my data science degree at Simon Fraser University, 
I am eager to embark on a promising career at Bell. I believe that the New Grad Program 
offered by Bell would be an ideal fit to kick-start my professional journey with the company.

Tell us about a time where you had to solve a difficult problem but did not have all necessary information to do so? Walk us through the steps and what was the final result. 



We divided our task into sub tasks that includes:
1. Gathered dog images to train and test our models 
2. models that were tained were of three types 
  2.1 Model 1 was to do dectection of dog from the uploaded image 
  2.2 Mode1 2 was to find the breed of the dog 
  2.3 Model 3 was the comarision of the lost dog image with found dog images and provide a score that shows the top 5 best matches
2. created a backend pipeline to link the results of each model 
2. Created Fask backend with Celeray to connect all the three models. 
3. Develop a front end application for the end user to help them to upload the lost dog image 
4. provide information to the end user of the found dog if it matches with the dog images of the found dogs 
5. used google places api to help user to locate the exact location of the lost dog  


Finally we presented an application thorigh which the user can upload a image, location of the lost dog. 
After uploading the image the image goes thorhough all the three models and then after some time (around 30 seconds) we 
send a notification and email to the user of the found dog if we found a match.  

We were a group of 5 students who decided to develop  a product aimed at helping find lost dogs. This was the final project 
for the data science lab course.  
To effectively manage the project, we divided the tasks into the following subtasks:

1. We collected a comprehensive dataset of dog images to train and test our machine learning models.
2. Three types of models were trained:
   2.1. Model 1 focused on detecting dogs within uploaded images.
   2.2. Model 2 aimed to identify the breed of the dog.
   2.3. Model 3 performed a comparison between the lost dog image and a database of found dog images, providing a score to indicate the top 5 potential matches.
3. A backend pipeline was created to seamlessly connect and coordinate the results from each of the models.
4. We developed a Flask backend integrated with Celery to facilitate the connection between the three models.
5. A user-friendly front-end application was designed to allow end users to easily upload images of lost dogs.
6. The application provided relevant information to the end user if a match was found among the uploaded images of found dogs.
7. To assist users in locating their lost dog, we leveraged the Google Places API to provide the exact location of where the dog was last seen.

In the end, we presented an application that enables users to upload an image and provide the 
location of a lost dog. Once the image is uploaded, it undergoes processing by the three models, 
which takes approximately 30 seconds. Upon finding a potential match, we promptly send a notification 
and email to the user, alerting them about the found dog.

Tell us about something you recently learned/ teach us something (it could be about technology, a new skill, a passion you have, a new initiative you’ve started/participated in etc.) 

Recently, I have delved into Flask for developing backend APIs. 
Python has gained significant popularity in the field of data science, and 
I believe Flask bridges the gap by allowing the seamless integration of 
machine learning models into real-time APIs built with Flask.

My passion lies in creating practical products that solve user problems. 
Additionally, I have a keen interest in working with various backend technologies, 
such as Flask, Node.js, Spring Boot, among others. It is crucial to carefully 
select a backend technology before embarking on developing a full-stack application. 
The learning curve for adopting a new backend framework like Flask becomes 
much easier if one already possesses a solid understanding of backend 
development using Node.js.

you had 2 mins to explain something you learned recently 

What is one thing you have recently learned? Or what is one initiative that you are passionate about? 


The first question asked to talk about yourself. 

Hello, my name is Anant Sunilam Awasthy. I recently completed my master's degree in Professional Data Science 
from Simon Fraser University. With over 5 years of industry experience and a master's degree, I am  
passionate about developing scalable products. I have had the opportunity to work in both startup and large-scale 
company environments. My journey began as a NodeJS backend developer, where I cultivated a keen interest in 
mobile app development, specifically for the Android platform.

During my professional tenure, I had the opportunity to create applications for customers to book movie 
tickets and develop dashboards to monitor the ticket booking process. In 2019, I joined Tata Digital, a 
prominent organization, where I worked as a full stack developer. This role allowed me to expand my expertise 
in both frontend and backend web application development. Notably, I contributed to the development of applications 
such as Tata Nue and Qmin.

In 2021, I made the decision to pursue a master's degree in data science from SFU. Throughout my studies, 
I acquired valuable tools and skills relevant to the field of data science. During my co-op experience, I had 
the opportunity to work on an open-source project for the University of British Columbia. In this role, I served 
as a full stack developer, where I contributed to the project by implementing new features, enhancing the backend 
through database migrations, and gaining proficiency in new technology stacks such as NodeJS with PostgreSQL on 
the backend and React on the frontend.

Answer Question 

What are the stuff you’ve learned recently 

Recently, I have leanred Flask for the backend API development. Additionally, I have recently started learning Dart which is used as 
a programing langaure to develop cross platform applications, and 
I have found Flutter to be a relatively easy framework to grasp. I make it a point to stay updated with the latest 
developments and stacks by following events like Google IO.
